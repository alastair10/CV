## About me

I am a proactive and adaptable **Full Stack Developer** with a background in the financial industry and tech startups in the UK (fintechs) and EU (healthcare). I have strong mix of analytical and commercial experience that extends across product management, financial analysis/modeling, strategy, and data analytics (stack: SQL/Python).

My interests in technical problem-solving, an endless yearning to understand how things work, and a desire to pursue a career with continuous learning opportunities have driven me to transition into software development.

My previous work and education have enabled me to build a skillset that combines significant commercial and technical experience in both analytical and client-facing roles. This has allowed me to deliver creative and practical solutions within team projects for clients, internal teams, and multiple C-level stakeholders/partners.
